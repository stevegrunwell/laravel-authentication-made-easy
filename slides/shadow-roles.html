  <h2>"The Shadow Role"</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Nice trick for apps that need fine-grained control over access</li>
    <li>Permissions populated via seeder</li>
    <li>CRUD interfaces to manage primary roles</li>
    <li>A hidden, non-public role, unique to each user, automatically created during <code>UsersController@store</code></li>
  </ul>
